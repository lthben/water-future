## Explanations of the technologies used

- This app was programmed in mostly vanilla JS with jQuery library for DOM manipulation and Bootstrap for CSS and layout tricks.

- Bootstrap helped a lot in terms of responsive layout. jQuery saved me a lot of typing for selecting and manipulating DOM elements.

## Approach taken

- I first dumped the quiz content into arrays, e.g. questions array, selection options array, answers array etc. Content was done by me earlier this year (Mar 2021) for a children's education workshop.

- I then worked on the colour scheme, layout and typography.

- I spent 80% of the time working on the UI/UX aspect, mimicking the user experience on similar professional e-learning websites for quiz content. This meant the need for a menu sidebar with progress tracking and navigational buttons, and making sure everything looks good on all screen sizes. This was the hardest part.
